Library and CLI to work with the ETH keystore file and extract latest validator cluster snapshot to build the payload:
1. Parse the private key using the keystore password
2. Use the private key to get shares for operators
3. Build the payload for the transaction

## Option 1: Running an Executable (Recommended route)

If you want to run a compiled version (easier option then CLI)

1. Go to the releases section: https://github.com/bloxapp/ssv-keys/releases
2. Select the latest release for the specific version of the CLI: `vX.Y.Z-v1` - for the first version of the contract, `vX.Y.Z-v2` - for second etc.
   Example: `v0.0.1-v1` or `v0.0.1-v2`.
3. Download the native executable for your operating system:
   * `ssv-keys-lin` - for Ubuntu Linux
   * `ssv-keys-mac` - for MacOS
   * `ssv-keys.exe` - for Windows
4. Open terminal and change the directory to where you downloaded the executable. For instance, on MacOS you can:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   ```
5. (Mac and Linux) Make sure that the executable has permissions to run by running:
   ```bash
   chmod 777 ./ssv-keys-mac
   ```
6. Now you can run it:
   ```bash
   ./ssv-keys-mac
   ```
7. If your operating system prevents you from running the executable you can open it from the file manager (Finder in case of MacOS), right click on it, and click the `Open` menu. Once open click the `Open` or `allow` button when you are asked to do so. After this go back to the console and try to run it again.

## Option 2: Running from the CLI

### Installation

This installation requires NodeJS on your machine.
You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once you have installed NodeJS, follow instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bloxapp/ssv-keys.git
cd ssv-keys
npm install -g yarn
yarn install
yarn cli --help
```

### Help

Help on available actions:

```bash
yarn cli --help
```

Help on a specific action:

```bash
yarn cli <action> --help
```


### Example

To run you will use the "shares" command

**Input parameters:**

- key-shares-version (ksv) = The version of the tool output, e.g. use "2" for previous version (optional)
- keystore (ks) = The validator keystore file path
- password (ps) = The keystore file encryption password
- operator-ids (oids) = Comma-separated list of operator IDs. The amount must be 3f+1 compatible.
- operator-keys (oks) = Comma-separated list of operator keys (same sequence as operator ids). The amount must be 3f+1 compatible.
- output-folder (of) = Target folder path to output the key shares file

```bash
yarn cli shares -ksv=3 --keystore=keystore.json --password=test --operators-ids=1,2,3,4 --operator-keys=LS..,LS..,LS..,LS.. --output-folder=./
```

**Output:**  Name will start with keyshares-timestamp.json

## Option 3: Integration in your projects

### Node Project

To run an example of a NodeJS project containing all the code snippets to build the share and transaction payload, simply follow these instructions!

```bash
cd examples/example-02
yarn install
```

To run a JavaScript example:

```bash
node example-simple.js
```

To run a TypeScript example:

```bash
yarn start
```

### Browser project (web application)

Go to the example folder and then install all the dependencies:

```bash
cd examples/react-app
yarn install
```

Start the web app:

```bash
yarn start
```

Open the developer console to see how it works in a browser environment.

## Development

### Run the CLI as a TypeScript executable:

```bash
yarn dev:cli ...
```

### Run the CLI as a JavaScript compiled executable:

```bash
yarn cli ...
```

### Lint

```bash
yarn lint
```

### Testing

```bash
yarn test
```

In watch mode during development

```bash
yarn test --watchAll
```

### Building

Build TypeScript into JavaScript

```bash
yarn build
```

Build for NodeJs using `esbuild`

```bash
yarn esbuild
```

Build everything

```bash
yarn build-all
```
